MiniUI is simple, some might say to fault. That's okay. I think it's one of those things where if you like it, you'll love it.

MiniUI is defined by no. No boxart thumbnails. No video previews. No background menu music. No custom themes. No also rans. MiniUI is full of self-loathing. It doesn't like launchers. It doesn't like being one. It wants to disappear and speed you on your way. Play games! Have fun! Stop fiddling with settings and overrides and scrapers and making everything just so before tossing the device in a drawer and doing it all over again with the next one. Just play!

## That was a lot.

Still here? Neat. MiniUI is unapologetically opinionated software. Sorry/not sorry.

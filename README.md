MiniUI is simple, some might say to a fault. That's okay. I think it's one of those things where, if you like it, even just a little bit, you'll love it. (For the uninitiated, MiniUI is a direct descendent of [MinUI](https://github.com/shauninman/MinUI) which itself is a distillation of the stock launcher and menu of the [Trimui Model S](http://www.trimui.com).)

MiniUI is defined by no. No boxart. No video previews. No background menu music. No custom themes. No also rans. MiniUI is too full of self-loathing for all that. It doesn't like launchers. It doesn't like being one. It wants to disappear and speed you on your way. MiniUI is unapologetically opinionated software. Sorry not sorry. 

Check the [Releases](https://github.com/shauninman/MiniUI/releases) for the latest and if you want more info before downloading, the readme included in every release is also available [here](https://github.com/shauninman/MiniUI/tree/main/skeleton). 

MiniUI maybe be simple but it's also extensible. See the [Extras readme](https://github.com/shauninman/MiniUI/tree/main/extras) for info on adding additional paks or creating your own.

## What happened to Union?

The Miyoo Mini happened. The idea behind [Union](https://github.com/shauninman/Union) was the result of having a few of these handhelds but never being fully happy with any one of them in every context. One had a beautiful screen but was too heavy to carry casually. One was perfectly pocketable and had amazingly clicky buttons but the tiny screen wasn't great for long play sessions. So Union allowed easily moving games and save data between devices depending on context. Literally just swapping the SD card from one device to the other. But the Miyoo Mini is pocketable enough, its screen gloriously 640 by 480 enough, that I stopped using the other devices supported by Union. In a past life I learned not to develop features I won't use. Maybe I'll revisit the Union idea in the future or maybe the Mini will remain enough for a long while.

alt core UI
	I figured out what I don't like about this:
		it forces a user to think about emulator meta in the launcher
		and creates an opportunity for indecision instead of helping
		them get out of their own way and just enjoy playing games

Pak Management
	installs/uninstalls paks?
	nah, you have to do the SD card shuffle anyways to add roms and bios, just do it manually

see if we can get access to the dmg grid color somehow
	not seeing a clean way
	what if I set a flag when we change an emu config
		then on the next frame use a special version of the dmg scaler that tries to find the 4 colors and sets the grid color
		yiiiikes
	limit dmg to just gambatte and pokemini?
		would still available on GBC games 

when resuming a quicksave set previous path to Recently Played
	it was disorienting in practice (because there's no current directory label)

add Time Limit.pak
	set duration
	auto-save and power off
	snooze option?
		would require deep integration, not worth it

support paks in arbitrary folders?
	eh, why?

Tools
	Scaling
		Pixel Perfect
		Always Aspect
	no. overrides, especially in a completely different location from where they're normaly set is bad

apply boot fix on install/update
	I have reservations about this since it's a one time thing
	we don't need to be touching nand every install/update

	NO SETTINGS!

Native Games (PAK)
	supports .pak/launch.sh
		see Cave Story.pak (not great)
	needs to disable SAVE/LOAD and auto power off (and no auto-save messages on manual power off)
	also the m3u must be named Cave Story.pak.m3u but then only the m3u extension is removed in getDisplayName()
	too much trouble

Boot Logo.pak
	risk of bricks too great

add Time Limit.pak
	set duration
	auto-save and power off
	snooze option?
		would require deep integration, not worth it

support paks in arbitrary folders?
	eh, why?

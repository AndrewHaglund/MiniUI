see if we can get access to the dmg grid color somehow
	not seeing a clean way
	what if I set a flag when we change an emu config
		then on the next frame use a special version of the dmg scaler that tries to find the 4 colors and sets the grid color
		yiiiikes
	limit dmg to just gambatte and pokemini?
		would still available on GBC games 

Native Games (PAK)
	supports .pak/launch.sh
		see Cave Story.pak (not great)
	needs to disable SAVE/LOAD and auto power off (and no auto-save messages on manual power off)
	also the m3u must be named Cave Story.pak.m3u but then only the m3u extension is removed in getDisplayName()
	too much trouble

Boot Logo.pak
	risk of bricks too great

add Time Limit.pak
	set duration
	auto-save and power off
	snooze option?
		would require deep integration, not worth it

support paks in arbitrary folders?
	eh, why?

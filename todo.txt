-------------------------------

Please see the README.txt in the zip file for installation and update instructions.

- fixed low battery icon flicker in game at non-native scales
- fixed saving datetime when powering off in game
- fixed audioserver crashing after opening and closing multiple games (thanks eggs)
- fixed save states created with custom bindings (now behave like native MiniUI save states) 
- updated SFC.pak in extras, renamed core (build process was stripping the mednafen_ prefix)
- added Clock.pak to extras (view or set datetime in absence of an RTC)

-------------------------------

===============================
upload v0.0.3 to github release
add libvorbis and libmad to non-arm miyoomini-toolchain-buildroot
and upload comparable v0.0.3 there too
for now I'm running the toolchain with a local v0.0.3 for vvvvvv
===============================

- mmenu keyrepeat isn't working

- quicksave and power off when /tmp/battery hits 5?
	change message when performing emergency power off
	maybe handle in keymon? then signal picoarch to shutdown

- maybe only change the bootcmd if "sleep" is present?

- revisit defaults and overrides for gambatte and mgba
	- mgba needs rumble strength setting

- disable alt changing in Simple mode (but honor previously configured alts)

- move Y:ALT logic into picoarch with a Cores option in the top level menu?
	pass multiple cores (in quotes?) to picoarch 
		split on space (or comma?)
		if doesn't start with a slash then prefix with CORE_PATH
		if doesn't end with _libretro.so add it
	use_core value stored in .picoarch/GB/picoarch.core or gamename.core
	this was a disaster see local aborted-cores branch of picoarch

- move all picoarch userdata folders into: 
	.picoarch/EMU_TAG/CORE_NAME/
	still?

- picoarch
	limit ff speed?
		poked at this, seemed simple enough but was more complicated when it came to actually implementing
		look at retroarch for ideas?

- can virtual boy be optimized at all?
	- are both screens rendered even though only one is used?
	- add frameskip?

- pcsx is going through some serious changes (besides the update to v2 options)
	wait for the dust to settle before considering updating

- test supafaust
	- msu-1
	- marvelous

- script checking core repos for newer commits?

- look at the way eggs clockd works and see if we can do something similar to add libmmenu to standalones
	- launch binary and pass it's pid to standalonemenu which listens for MENU and sends a sig STOP to the previous binary?

- add an Extended Font.pak?

- picoarch
	truncate the common parts of a group of options, not the (usually unique) ends
	see if rewind is easy to add
	integrate cheat support into MiniUI

- look into CamOS and MI_ERRs in MiniUI and picoarch
	- probably tied to both settings and SDL trying to restore audio volume?
	- add logging to try to bookend the errors to identify their source then untangle the cause

- look into removing trimui patches from picoarch cores, breaking on latest core commits, see pcsx_rearmed

- add Single-use paks to extras Tools (Add/Remove MiniUI Boot Logo and Update Boot Command)

- BUG: repo doesn't checkout correct branch for submodules when cloned...
	tried but didn't work
		git submodule set-branch -b miniui-miyoomini third-party/picoarch
	maybe
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1777854/how-can-i-specify-a-branch-tag-when-adding-a-git-submodule/18799234#18799234
		this worked for everything but SDL I think

- faqs
- known issues

- document auto.sh
	- can `trap "sync && reboot" EXIT` or similar be used to catch errors in auto.sh and prevent stock from polluting the SD card?
	trap "sync && reboot && sleep 10" ERR && set -E # NO
	see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29427364/non-bash-equivalent-to-trap-err
	eggs: It should be noted that in the new FW, reboot will terminate and continue to run for some time afterwards.

- BUG: say doesn't seem to respect extra line returns at end of msg

- BUG: I think show et al need to make sure pan is set to 0,0?
	using after progressui sometimes results in the image not showing

- use smsplus-gx for SMS/GG?

- scroll long names
	ugh, this will be harder than it needs to be because of the old Union cross-platform separation
- press L on a save state to lock/unlock it? to make it the default state to open instead of a cold launch?

- auto-adjust brightness based on screen effect?

change all logging from &> log to > log 2>&1

- show, confirm, and say don't sleep (neither does Files.pak)
	thinking face

-------------------------------

Please see the README.txt in the zip file for installation and update instructions.

- updated button names in Advanced > Options > Player controls (PokÃ©mon mini, Game Boy Advance, TurboGrafx-16)
- fixed potential slowdowns caused by custom SDL audio implementation (thanks eggs!)
- fixed PlayStation frameskip
- fixed crash in German version of Pokemon FireRed (thanks d30r!)
- switched Genesis picodrive core to irixxxx's version for Vectorman fix (possibly only temporarily)
- updated picoarch to warn when a core doesn't support save states, auto-poweroff, or quicksave and resume
- updated libmmenu to visually disable Save and Load if the core does not support save states
- added Native Games to extras Roms, includes Cave Story and VVVVVV (both BYOD of course, see their individual readmes)
- added warn binary to use when a native game doesn't support save states, auto-poweroff, or quicksave and resume
- fixed audio popping when run on the 20220419 official firmware or later (thanks eggs!)

-------------------------------

===============================
move ~/Downloads/tmp/miyoomini-toolchain-buildroot-aarch64/ somewhere permanent
upload v0.0.3 to github release
add libvorbis and libmad to non-arm miyoomini-toolchain-buildroot
and upload comparable v0.0.3 there too
for now I'm running the toolchain with a local v0.0.3 for vvvvvv
===============================

- changes cores.txt to commits.txt and note every submodule and sub-repo's commit at build time

- check mystic quest after exiting in-game menu (not libmmenu)
	- libretro/snes9x2005 doesn't have this issue

- switch all cores to libretro?

- compare my core build flags to classic_armv7_a7 build flags

- add an Extended Font.pak?

- can I move from snes9x2005_plus to just snes9x2005 without breaking save states
	no
	but I can provide plus as an extras pak for people who want to continue using it

- look into Evil_Rob's performance regression
	he's concerned with an unofficial fba core but maybe this could explain random spell slowdowns in FFIX
	see ~/Downloads/FBN.pak.zip
	can't reproduce, steady 60fps with provided files

- reports of glitchy boot logo after applying glitch fix?
	increase sleep after lcd init
		doesn't prevent boot logo flicker
	try undoing boot glitch fix
		without the boot glitch fix the logo scrolls vertically
	eggs says nothing has changed and I'm inclined to defer to his judgement

- picoarch
	truncate the common parts of a group of options, not the (usually unique) ends
	see if rewind is easy to add
	integrate cheat support into MiniUI

- look into CamOS and MI_ERRs in MiniUI and picoarch
	- probably tied to both settings and SDL trying to restore audio volume?
	- add logging to try to bookend the errors to identify their source then untangle the cause
- look into removing trimui patches from picoarch cores, breaking on latest core commits, see pcsx_rearmed

- add Single-use paks to extras Tools (Add/Remove MiniUI Boot Logo and Update Boot Command)

- BUG: repo doesn't checkout correct branch for submodules when cloned...
	tried but didn't work
		git submodule set-branch -b miniui-miyoomini third-party/picoarch
	maybe

- faqs
- known issues

- document auto.sh
	- can `trap "sync && reboot" EXIT` or similar be used to catch errors in auto.sh and prevent stock from polluting the SD card?
	trap "sync && reboot && sleep 10" ERR && set -E # NO
	see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29427364/non-bash-equivalent-to-trap-err
	eggs: It should be noted that in the new FW, reboot will terminate and continue to run for some time afterwards.


- BUG: say doesn't seem to respect extra line returns at end of msg

- BUG: I think show et al need to make sure pan is set to 0,0?
	using after progressui sometimes results in the image not showing

- use smsplus-gx for SMS/GG?
- look into supafaust
	is it just the new hotness or an actual improvement over snes9x
		is audio better or worse?
	might have MSU-1 support, which, eh, is fine for extras but not essential
	might have better SuperFX chip support


- scroll long names
	ugh, this will be harder than it needs to be because of the old Union cross-platform separation
- press L on a save state to lock/unlock it? to make it the default state to open instead of a cold launch?

	
- auto-adjust brightness based on screen effect?

change all logging from &> log to > log 2>&1

- show, confirm, and say don't sleep (neither does Files.pak)
	thinking face

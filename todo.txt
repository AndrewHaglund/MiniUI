-------------------------------

- added Single-use paks to extras Tools (Add/Remove MiniUI Boot Logo and Update Boot Command)
- fixed swapfile disabled after use

-------------------------------

- run boot logo paks by eggs/evil rob?
- match Onion's battery reading?
	https://github.com/jimgraygit/Onion/blob/main/src/ADC/main.c#L112
	ease towards the current value by 1% every check

- BUG: Sega CD might need a short delay to resume audio like pokemini
	https://github.com/shauninman/picoarch/blob/miniui-miyoomini/patches/pokemini/0001-fix-resume-audio.patch

- auto-adjust brightness based on screen effect?
- faqs
- document auto.sh
	- can `trap "sync && reboot" EXIT` or similar be used to catch errors in auto.sh and prevent stock from polluting the SD card?
	trap "sync && reboot && sleep 10" ERR && set -E # NO
	see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29427364/non-bash-equivalent-to-trap-err
	eggs: It should be noted that in the new FW, reboot will terminate and continue to run for some time afterwards.

- can picoarch detect if a core supports save states?
	StupidHoroscope: From my messing around with it, there's a method in libretro cores called retro_serialize_size(), and if that returns zero, save-states aren't supported.
	https://docs.libretro.com/development/cores/developing-cores/#retro_serialize_size-retro_serialize-and-retro_unserialize 

- BUG: say doesn't seem to respect extra line returns at end of msg
- BUG: repo doesn't checkout correct branch for submodules when cloned...

- look into an audioserver-like approach to eliminating pop
	- I think picoarch already has a resampler...
	
- look into supafaust
	is it just the new hotness or an actual improvement over snes9x
	it might have MSU-1 support, which, eh, is fine for extras but not essential

- BUG: I think show et al need to make sure pan is set to 0,0?
	using after progressui sometimes results in the image not showing

- use smsplus-gx for SMS/GG?

- BUG: default st8 assumes first disc on multi-disc games
	- leaving for now

- scroll long names
	ugh, this will be harder than it needs to be because of the old Union cross-platform separation
- press L on a save state to lock/unlock it? to make it the default state to open instead of a cold launch?

picoarch should truncate the common parts of a group of options, not the (usually unique) ends

add enable-simple-mode to readme

show, confirm, and say don't sleep (neither does Files.pak)
	thinking face

wrap all $(dirname "$0") in quotes to properly escape paths with spaces
	or store the result in a var then quote the var when using

change all logging from &> log to > log 2>&1

do another pass at defaults?

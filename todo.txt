-------------------------------

- removed beta from release name
- removed alpha- and beta-specific update features
- added miyoo firmware to version info (thanks eggs)

-------------------------------

- look into supafaust
	is it just the new hotness or an actual improvement over snes9x
	it might have MSU-1 support, which, eh, is fine for extras but not essential

- BUG: I think show et al need to make sure pan is set to 0,0?
	using after progressui sometimes results in the image not showing
- BUG: rumble not working in gambatte (does work on Onion)

- use smsplus-gx for SMS/GG?

- BUG: default st8 assumes first disc on multi-disc games
	- leaving for now

- scroll long names
	ugh, this will be harder than it needs to be because of the old Union cross-platform separation
- press L on a save state to lock/unlock it? to make it the default state to open instead of a cold launch?

picoarch should truncate the common parts of a group of options, not the (usually unique) ends

make keymon write averaged/smoothed and scaled values to /tmp/adc or better yet msettings
	check totofaki's battery curves (last I checked mine were the same as stock)

add enable-simple-mode to readme

show, confirm, and say don't sleep (neither does Files.pak)
	thinking face

wrap all $(dirname "$0") in quotes to properly escape paths with spaces
	or store the result in a var then quote the var when using

change all logging from &> log to > log 2>&1

do another pass at defaults?

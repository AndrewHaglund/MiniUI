-------------------------------

Please see the README.txt in the zip file for installation and update instructions.

- fixed button names in Advaned > Options > Player controls (PokÃ©mon mini, Game Boy Advance, TurboGrafx-16)

-------------------------------

- increase sleep after lcd init
	doesn't prevent boot logo flicker
	try undoing boot glitch fix
		without the boot glitch fix the logo scrolls vertically
- audio fix
	- works! (on latest firmware)
	- see egg's miniui_audioserver.zip

		includes latency_reduction, source here:

- picoarch
	check emulator Player Controls for Fast Fwd and remove if present and doesn't work
	check me_bind_action in overrides to make sure we're mapping all buttons by name
		eg. gambatte is mapped, pokemini is not
			because pokemini hasn't defined any :face_palm:
			beetle-pce-fast might be looking for the wrong name because it's named mednafen_pce_fast_libretro.so
	truncate the common parts of a group of options, not the (usually unique) ends
	see if rewind is easy to add
	integrate cheat support into MiniUI

- added Sega CD to extras (see updated extras readme for required bios)
	- pulled after reports of 
		- crashes on autoresume and 
		- extra slashes in .brm paths
	- added to extras readme:
		MCD: bios_CD_U.bin, bios_CD_E.bin, bios_CD_J.bin
		

- try removing 3x scaler, bumping to 4x where 3x is requested or down to 2x if 4x is too large
	- FFVI runs at 45fps at 3x or 4x

- look into CamOS and MI_ERRs in MiniUI and picoarch
	- probably tied to both settings and SDL trying to restore audio volume?
	- add logging to try to bookend the errors to identify their source then untangle the cause
- look into removing trimui patches from picoarch cores, breaking on latest core commits, see pcsx_rearmed

- BUG: vectorman 1 and 2 fail to load on MiniUI
	Onion is using 688c90d5bd017d21b9bcee99a4aa83c5224711a0 (Dec 29 2021)
	latest on libretro is 22 days ago https://github.com/libretro/picodrive/commit/7ff457f2f833570013f2a7e2608ac40632e0735d
		it was fixed 19 days ago https://github.com/irixxxx/picodrive/commit/72c2a04a9d4ae0fe52383dbf4d680849036b48a1
	plays fine on genesis_plus_gx

- add Single-use paks to extras Tools (Add/Remove MiniUI Boot Logo and Update Boot Command)


- BUG: repo doesn't checkout correct branch for submodules when cloned...
	tried but didn't work
		git submodule set-branch -b miniui-miyoomini third-party/picoarch
	maybe

- faqs
- document auto.sh
	- can `trap "sync && reboot" EXIT` or similar be used to catch errors in auto.sh and prevent stock from polluting the SD card?
	trap "sync && reboot && sleep 10" ERR && set -E # NO
	see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29427364/non-bash-equivalent-to-trap-err
	eggs: It should be noted that in the new FW, reboot will terminate and continue to run for some time afterwards.

- can picoarch detect if a core supports save states?
	StupidHoroscope: From my messing around with it, there's a method in libretro cores called retro_serialize_size(), and if that returns zero, save-states aren't supported.
	https://docs.libretro.com/development/cores/developing-cores/#retro_serialize_size-retro_serialize-and-retro_unserialize 

- BUG: say doesn't seem to respect extra line returns at end of msg

- BUG: I think show et al need to make sure pan is set to 0,0?
	using after progressui sometimes results in the image not showing

- use smsplus-gx for SMS/GG?
- look into supafaust
	is it just the new hotness or an actual improvement over snes9x
		is audio better or worse?
	might have MSU-1 support, which, eh, is fine for extras but not essential
	might have better SuperFX chip support


- BUG: default st8 assumes first disc on multi-disc games
	- leaving for now

- scroll long names
	ugh, this will be harder than it needs to be because of the old Union cross-platform separation
- press L on a save state to lock/unlock it? to make it the default state to open instead of a cold launch?


- do another pass at defaults?
	
- help entry for confirm is inaccessible (args are optional so there's no good way to provide without testing for something like -h or --help)
- auto-adjust brightness based on screen effect?

change all logging from &> log to > log 2>&1

- show, confirm, and say don't sleep (neither does Files.pak)
	thinking face

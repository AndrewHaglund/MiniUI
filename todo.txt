- look into removing trimui patches from picoarch cores, breaking on latest core commits, see pcsx_rearmed
- BUG: vectorman 1 and 2 fail to load on MiniUI
- add Single-use paks to extras Tools (Add/Remove MiniUI Boot Logo and Update Boot Command)

- try removing 3x scaler, bumping to 4x where 3x is requested or down to 2x if 4x is too large

- BUG: repo doesn't checkout correct branch for submodules when cloned...
	tried but didn't work
		git submodule set-branch -b miniui-miyoomini third-party/picoarch
	maybe
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1777854/how-can-i-specify-a-branch-tag-when-adding-a-git-submodule/18799234#18799234

- check me_bind_action in overrides to make sure we're mapping all buttons by name
	eg. gambatte is mapped, pokemini is not
		because pokemini hasn't defined any :face_palm:
		beetle-pce-fast might be looking for the wrong name because it's named mednafen_pce_fast_libretro.so

- picoarch
	check emulator Player Controls for Fast Fwd and remove if present and doesn't work
	see if rewind is easy to add
	integrate cheat support into MiniUI
	truncate the common parts of a group of options, not the (usually unique) ends

- BUG: Sega CD might need a short delay to resume audio like pokemini
	https://github.com/shauninman/picoarch/blob/miniui-miyoomini/patches/pokemini/0001-fix-resume-audio.patch

- faqs
- document auto.sh
	- can `trap "sync && reboot" EXIT` or similar be used to catch errors in auto.sh and prevent stock from polluting the SD card?
	trap "sync && reboot && sleep 10" ERR && set -E # NO
	see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29427364/non-bash-equivalent-to-trap-err
	eggs: It should be noted that in the new FW, reboot will terminate and continue to run for some time afterwards.

- can picoarch detect if a core supports save states?
	StupidHoroscope: From my messing around with it, there's a method in libretro cores called retro_serialize_size(), and if that returns zero, save-states aren't supported.
	https://docs.libretro.com/development/cores/developing-cores/#retro_serialize_size-retro_serialize-and-retro_unserialize 

- BUG: say doesn't seem to respect extra line returns at end of msg

- BUG: I think show et al need to make sure pan is set to 0,0?
	using after progressui sometimes results in the image not showing

- use smsplus-gx for SMS/GG?
- look into supafaust
	is it just the new hotness or an actual improvement over snes9x
	it might have MSU-1 support, which, eh, is fine for extras but not essential


- look into an audioserver-like approach to eliminating pop
	- I think picoarch already has a resampler...

- BUG: default st8 assumes first disc on multi-disc games
	- leaving for now

- scroll long names
	ugh, this will be harder than it needs to be because of the old Union cross-platform separation
- press L on a save state to lock/unlock it? to make it the default state to open instead of a cold launch?


- do another pass at defaults?
	
- help entry for confirm is inaccessible (args are optional so there's no good way to provide without testing for something like -h or --help)
- auto-adjust brightness based on screen effect?

change all logging from &> log to > log 2>&1

- show, confirm, and say don't sleep (neither does Files.pak)
	thinking face

-------------------------------

- simplified emu launch.sh
- moved PokÃ©mon mini to Extras (barely an also ran)

-------------------------------

- add list of stock systems to readme
- makefile copies all libretro cores from picoarch
	manually copy the desired ones to either .system or extras
- update EMU_DIR var name for easier swapping with CORES_PATH
- prepare an MiniUI_Extras.zip?
	- move pokemini to extras
	- add game gear
	- add master system
	- add turbo grafx-16
	- Pak Management
- document extras
	Emus
		paks + cores
	Tools
		paks

- extract tag name from $EMU_DIR in launch.sh?
- scroll long names
	ugh, this will be harder than it needs to be because of the old Union cross-platform separation
- press L on a save state to lock/unlock it? to make it the default state to open instead of a cold launch?

picoarch should truncate the common parts of a group of options, not the (usually unique) ends

make keymon write averaged/smoothed and scaled values to /tmp/adc or better yet msettings
	check totofaki's battery curves (last I checked mine were the same as stock)

make sure Recently Played and libmmenu display the m3u file name instead of the content name
	libmmenu was easy
	Recently Played will be much more involved...
		because it is currently set to a specific disc
		which maybe isn't necessary since resume works from the m3u dir in the console folder? 
		but is that because open dir gets the specific disc?

add enable-simple-mode to readme

show, confirm, and say don't sleep (neither does Files.pak)
	thinking face

wrap all $(dirname "$0") in quotes to properly escape paths with spaces
	or store the result in a var then quote the var when using

change all logging from &> log to > log 2>&1

do another pass at defaults?

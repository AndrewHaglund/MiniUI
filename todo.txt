-------------------------------

Please see the README.txt in the zip file for installation and update instructions.

- renamed SFC.pak extras core (build process was stripping the mednafen_ prefix, change should have no impact on users)

-------------------------------

===============================
upload v0.0.3 to github release
add libvorbis and libmad to non-arm miyoomini-toolchain-buildroot
and upload comparable v0.0.3 there too
for now I'm running the toolchain with a local v0.0.3 for vvvvvv
===============================

- MiniUI failing to boot on subsquent launches (unless powered?)
	might be sd card related
	https://www.reddit.com/r/MiyooMini/comments/v7plxb/miniui_does_not_consistently_load_when_powering/
	eggs points out that even reboot && sleep 10 won't work if the shell crashes
	add `killall main` to (could have bad repercussions, eg. a boot loop)
		MiniUI.pak/launch.sh
		/miyoo/app/MainUI
	
	is it related to the updated bootcmd in april ofw
		does the Fix Boot Graphics Glitch patch also fix this issue (which might explain why I'm not encountering it)

- picoarch
	saves created with a custom binding aren't registered in MiniUI or libmmenu
	that's going to be hard to fix...
	if launched with slot 8 reset slot index to last used (I think it's supposed to be doing that)
		maybe its only being reset in mmenu and not picoarch?

- confirm that current time is written on power off

- did I ever test low battery on new aspect/fullscreen?

- reimplement compatiblity/performance core toggle
	- test the hell out of this
		- eg. it's currently breaking resume, it loads in the default core even if it was powered off in the alt core
	- should these be special paks in extras? probably since changing core could result in save data loss (or the appearance of)

	- disable toggle in simple mode
	- separate alt and primary .mmenu folders
		- but use primary for .use-alt files
	- add core name to picoarch main menu
	- reconsider UI
		- two dots?
		- replace B instead off adding to left side buttons
		- toggle is a one time thing, show a dialog instead of flare?
			- can the pak provide a description of what each does? buttons are B:CANCEL or A:CHANGE? B:DEFAULT or A:ALT?
			- eg. The default prioritizes compatibility while the alternate might offer better performance in certain games.
			- or. The default prioritizes compatibility while the alternate supports rumble.
			- or. The default prioritizes compatibliity while the alternate offers Super Game Boy borders.
	- SFC
		snes9x2005_plus
		mednafen_supafaust
	- GB/GBC
		gambatte
		mgba
	- GBA
		gpsp
		mgba
	- setup mgba overrides
		- Skip BIOS Intro = enabled
		- Frameskip Interval = 4 (or 3?)
		- buttons too!
	- patch in interval?

- Tools/
	Scaling/
		Pixel Perfectionist or Pixel Perfect
		Aspect Aficionado	or Always Aspect
		Fullscreen Fanatic  or Really? Fullscreen?

- can virtual boy be optimized at all?
	- are both screens rendered even though only one is used?
	- add frameskip?

- left audioserver.mod name unchanged
	test on April ofw

- sm64 port?
	https://github.com/FunKey-Project/sm64-port/commit/095739d30de69c8a2d852bd9166305a3d576e4c3

- reports of psx crashing after 15-20 minutes in 0529
	audioserver-related?

- pcsx is going through some serious changes (besides the update to v2 options)
	wait for the dust to settle before considering updating

- test supafaust
	- msu-1
	- marvelous

- script checking core repos for newer commits?

- look at the way eggs clockd works and see if we can do something similar to add libmmenu to standalones
	- launch binary and pass it's pid to standalonemenu which listens for MENU and sends a sig STOP to the previous binary?

- add an Extended Font.pak?

- picoarch
	truncate the common parts of a group of options, not the (usually unique) ends
	see if rewind is easy to add
	integrate cheat support into MiniUI

- look into CamOS and MI_ERRs in MiniUI and picoarch
	- probably tied to both settings and SDL trying to restore audio volume?
	- add logging to try to bookend the errors to identify their source then untangle the cause

- look into removing trimui patches from picoarch cores, breaking on latest core commits, see pcsx_rearmed

- add Single-use paks to extras Tools (Add/Remove MiniUI Boot Logo and Update Boot Command)

- BUG: repo doesn't checkout correct branch for submodules when cloned...
	tried but didn't work
		git submodule set-branch -b miniui-miyoomini third-party/picoarch
	maybe
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1777854/how-can-i-specify-a-branch-tag-when-adding-a-git-submodule/18799234#18799234
		this worked for everything but SDL I think

- faqs
- known issues

- document auto.sh
	- can `trap "sync && reboot" EXIT` or similar be used to catch errors in auto.sh and prevent stock from polluting the SD card?
	trap "sync && reboot && sleep 10" ERR && set -E # NO
	see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29427364/non-bash-equivalent-to-trap-err
	eggs: It should be noted that in the new FW, reboot will terminate and continue to run for some time afterwards.

- BUG: say doesn't seem to respect extra line returns at end of msg

- BUG: I think show et al need to make sure pan is set to 0,0?
	using after progressui sometimes results in the image not showing

- use smsplus-gx for SMS/GG?

- scroll long names
	ugh, this will be harder than it needs to be because of the old Union cross-platform separation
- press L on a save state to lock/unlock it? to make it the default state to open instead of a cold launch?

- auto-adjust brightness based on screen effect?

change all logging from &> log to > log 2>&1

- show, confirm, and say don't sleep (neither does Files.pak)
	thinking face

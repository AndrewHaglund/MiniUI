-------------------------------

- changed default Game Gear Screen effect to LCD in extras
- fixed Recently Played showing disc instead of m3u file for display name

-------------------------------

- BUG: multi-disc m3u-based games resume breaks if their path has changed
	- the issue is in the full path being written in .mmenu/TAG/Game.m3u.0.txt
	- path should be relative to the m3u

- remove -beta from release name?
- eggs wants to update screenshot to use current binary or rom name
- BUG: I think show et al need to make sure pan is set to 0,0?
- BUG: rumble not working in gambatte (does work on Onion)
- use smsplus-gx for SMS/GG?
- BUG: default st8 assumes first disc on multi-disc games

- scroll long names
	ugh, this will be harder than it needs to be because of the old Union cross-platform separation
- press L on a save state to lock/unlock it? to make it the default state to open instead of a cold launch?

picoarch should truncate the common parts of a group of options, not the (usually unique) ends

make keymon write averaged/smoothed and scaled values to /tmp/adc or better yet msettings
	check totofaki's battery curves (last I checked mine were the same as stock)

make sure Recently Played and libmmenu display the m3u file name instead of the content name
	libmmenu was easy
	Recently Played will be much more involved...
		because it is currently set to a specific disc
		which maybe isn't necessary since resume works from the m3u dir in the console folder? 
		but is that because open dir gets the specific disc?

add enable-simple-mode to readme

show, confirm, and say don't sleep (neither does Files.pak)
	thinking face

wrap all $(dirname "$0") in quotes to properly escape paths with spaces
	or store the result in a var then quote the var when using

change all logging from &> log to > log 2>&1

do another pass at defaults?

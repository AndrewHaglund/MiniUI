prepare instructions for restoring data from MiniUI alpha
	which means I need to install the alpha on a card :sweat_smile:

auto install updates?

make sure updater doesn't clobber unofficial Emu paks

only copy libs on aarch64 platforms
	or if gcc version == 9.2

make keymon write averaged/smoothed and scaled values to /tmp/adc or better yet msettings

INSTALL/UPDATE
	MiniUI.zip (containing just .system) is unzipped at the root of the card

AUTOSAVE
	still a little bit of a tangle (libmmenu.c and common.c call reboot)
	emulator provides an autosave function and requests a state (menu, sleep, or power off)
	libmmenu will handle the emulator requested state as well as any state changes it itself initiates
	what if we could signal to keymon to shut it all down?

Please see the README.txt in the zip file for installation and update instructions.

-------------------------------

===============================
upload v0.0.3 to github release
add libvorbis and libmad to non-arm miyoomini-toolchain-buildroot
and upload comparable v0.0.3 there too
for now I'm running the toolchain with a local v0.0.3 for vvvvvv
===============================

- address eggs supafaust renaming concerns
	- figure out how to handle the difference between repo and product name
		- this changes the name of the local repo folder 
	- handle change in picoarch overrides and patches
		- rename patch folder
		- rename core_name in supafaust_overrides struct
			- this didn't map (because the settings names changed?)
			- no, probably becaues that change is in a header file and I didn't make clean before rebuilding (yes)
		- will this break all settings names? :cold_sweat:
			- no (phew!)
	- handle change in MiniUI's makefile
	- ugh, this will break the hidden .picoarch-SFC-supafaust config folder
		- will need to address that in a post-update script?
			- if old folder exists and renamed core exists rename folder to match renamed core
			- no, won't work if they update out of order (eg. MiniUI then SFC.pak or if they have renamed the emu tag)
		- perform update from the updated SFC.pak/launch.sh so
			 - works if they update MiniUI on one boot and the SFC.pak on another
			 - works if they've changed the name of the pak (eg. SUPA.pak)
	- ugh, will this mess up save state resume paths?
		- no (phew!)

- left audioserver.mod name unchanged
	test on April ofw

- reports of psx crashing after 15-20 minutes in 0529
	audioserver-related?

- pcsx is going through some serious changes (besides the update to v2 options)
	wait for the dust to settle before considering updating

- test supafaust
	- msu-1
	- marvelous

- script checking core repos for newer commits?

- look at the way eggs clockd works and see if we can do something similar to add libmmenu to standalones
	- launch binary and pass it's pid to standalonemenu which listens for MENU and sends a sig STOP to the previous binary?

- add an Extended Font.pak?

- picoarch
	truncate the common parts of a group of options, not the (usually unique) ends
	see if rewind is easy to add
	integrate cheat support into MiniUI

- look into CamOS and MI_ERRs in MiniUI and picoarch
	- probably tied to both settings and SDL trying to restore audio volume?
	- add logging to try to bookend the errors to identify their source then untangle the cause

- look into removing trimui patches from picoarch cores, breaking on latest core commits, see pcsx_rearmed

- add Single-use paks to extras Tools (Add/Remove MiniUI Boot Logo and Update Boot Command)

- BUG: repo doesn't checkout correct branch for submodules when cloned...
	tried but didn't work
		git submodule set-branch -b miniui-miyoomini third-party/picoarch
	maybe
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1777854/how-can-i-specify-a-branch-tag-when-adding-a-git-submodule/18799234#18799234
		this worked for everything but SDL I think

- faqs
- known issues

- document auto.sh
	- can `trap "sync && reboot" EXIT` or similar be used to catch errors in auto.sh and prevent stock from polluting the SD card?
	trap "sync && reboot && sleep 10" ERR && set -E # NO
	see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29427364/non-bash-equivalent-to-trap-err
	eggs: It should be noted that in the new FW, reboot will terminate and continue to run for some time afterwards.

- BUG: say doesn't seem to respect extra line returns at end of msg

- BUG: I think show et al need to make sure pan is set to 0,0?
	using after progressui sometimes results in the image not showing

- use smsplus-gx for SMS/GG?

- scroll long names
	ugh, this will be harder than it needs to be because of the old Union cross-platform separation
- press L on a save state to lock/unlock it? to make it the default state to open instead of a cold launch?

- auto-adjust brightness based on screen effect?

change all logging from &> log to > log 2>&1

- show, confirm, and say don't sleep (neither does Files.pak)
	thinking face

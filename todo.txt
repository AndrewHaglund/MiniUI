Update.pak should kill keymon

show, confirm, and say don't sleep (neither does Files.pak)

add MENU+POWER force shutdown combo to readme
add enable-simple-mode to readme
add supported bios to readme

use miyoo folder to auto install/update?
	instead of copying over the zip just copy the miyoo folder?
		which contains the zip
		and the miyoo folder is deleted after install/update
	unzip bare minimum to update/install then launch progressui?
		install just displays graphic
		update setsup bin/lib paths to use existing progressui?
			 but doesn't use progress because bin will move shortly there after?
			 can I replace .tmp_update while .tmp_update/updater is running? (I'm guessing not, so I probably need to move it then unzip)
	MainUI could install or update based on presence of .system
	this way we bypass .tmp_update/updater until the install/update is complete

auto update next before anything else
	make sure pak and core retention is really working before enabling this!
	update should be a two phase process (so the update logic comes from the updated Update.pak not the out of date one)
		extract system if zip is present
		continue updating from the new system if no zip is present
	I keep adding an update then forgetting to run it :facepalm:
	remove post-install.sh after updating too

settings bound to MENU button?

wrap all $(dirname "$0") in quotes to properly escape paths with spaces
	or store the result in a var then quote the var when using
change all logging from &> log to > log 2>&1

add pak to install MiniUI boot logo?
auto install updates?
	introduce in the last beta?

do another pass at defaults

make keymon write averaged/smoothed and scaled values to /tmp/adc or better yet msettings

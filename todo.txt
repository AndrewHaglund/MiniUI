auto update next before anything else
	I keep adding an update then forgetting to run it :facepalm:

remove post-install.sh when updating

enable open/resuming from m3u hosted folder 
	but leave the disc listing logic in place in case I need to revert
	


after disc change
	Recently Played shows both discs until you load another game
		the new one has /mnt/SDCARD in the path, all the others don't
	doesn't let you resume from new disc even if you create a save
		this might be because that save overwrites the slot on the previous disc?

shared states across multi-disc
	mmenu bmp are named after the m3u file
		has txt pair that holds the disc path for that state
	miniui
		can_resume
		should_resume
		Entry_open


add secret default state to libmmenu/picoarch
	

update.log is back
	
mmenu doesn't know a disc has changed
	I think picoarch doesn't update its paths when that happens which causes the confusion
	disc_replace_index() core.c needs to update (might need to happen in main.c)
		should disc_replace_index return the new content struct instead of freeing it?
		content->path
		save_template_path -> content_based_name(content, save_template_path, MAX_PATH, config_dir, NULL, ".st%i");

wrap all $(dirname "$0") in quotes to properly escape paths with spaces
	or store the result in a var then quote the var when using
change all logging from &> log to > log 2>&1

add Time Limit.pak
	set duration
	auto-save and power off
	snooze option?
add pak to install MiniUI boot logo?
add Version.pak?
	requires some sort of simple show or rather say command
auto install updates?
	introduce in the last beta?

do another pass at defaults

make keymon write averaged/smoothed and scaled values to /tmp/adc or better yet msettings

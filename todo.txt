-------------------------------

- fixed truncated sub-folder listings
- fixed power off display issues on latest firmware
- updated display name cruft trimmer logic
- added trimming leading metadata from display name for better control over sort order
- fixed auto-resume in user installed emulator paks

-------------------------------

- handle new audioserver
- extract tag name in launch.sh?
- document extras
	Emus
	Tools

- scroll long names
	ugh, this will be harder than it needs to be because of the old Union cross-platform separation
- add actual version number to version message (or not?)
- press L on a save state to lock/unlock it?

picoarch should truncate the common parts of a group of options, not the (usually unique) ends

make keymon write averaged/smoothed and scaled values to /tmp/adc or better yet msettings
	check totofaki's battery curves (last I checked mine were the same as stock)

make sure Recently Played and libmmenu display the m3u file name instead of the content name
	libmmenu was easy
	Recently Played will be much more involved...
		because it is currently set to a specific disc
		which maybe isn't necessary since resume works from the m3u dir in the console folder? 
		but is that because open dir gets the specific disc?


add enable-simple-mode to readme

show, confirm, and say don't sleep (neither does Files.pak)
	thinking face

wrap all $(dirname "$0") in quotes to properly escape paths with spaces
	or store the result in a var then quote the var when using

change all logging from &> log to > log 2>&1

do another pass at defaults?

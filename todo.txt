start tracking a changelog

add Version to version :sweat_smile:

make keymon write averaged/smoothed and scaled values to /tmp/adc or better yet msettings
	check totofaki's battery curves (last I checked mine were the same as stock)

make sure Recently Played and libmmenu display the m3u file name instead of the content name
	libmmenu was easy
	Recently Played will be much more involved...
		because it is currently set to a specific disc
		which maybe isn't necessary since resume works from the m3u dir in the console folder? 
		but is that because open dir gets the specific disc?

create an Also Rans.zip of additional cores

add enable-simple-mode to readme

show, confirm, and say don't sleep (neither does Files.pak)
	thinking face

wrap all $(dirname "$0") in quotes to properly escape paths with spaces
	or store the result in a var then quote the var when using
change all logging from &> log to > log 2>&1

do another pass at defaults

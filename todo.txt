enable open/resuming from m3u hosted folder
	but leave the disc listing logic in place in case I need to revert
	kinda working, changing discs breaks the last path...

auto update next before anything else
	TODO: Update isn't restoring custom paks with spaces in the name
	update should be a two phase process (so the update logic comes from the updated Update.pak not the out of date one)
		extract system if zip is present
		continue updating from the new system if no zip is present
	I keep adding an update then forgetting to run it :facepalm:
	remove post-install.sh after updating too

simple mode
	.userdata/enable-simple-mode
	create Tools/Enable Simple Mode.pak
		requires bin/confirm

add secret default state to libmmenu/picoarch for Evil_Rob

update.log is back
	
wrap all $(dirname "$0") in quotes to properly escape paths with spaces
	or store the result in a var then quote the var when using
change all logging from &> log to > log 2>&1

add Time Limit.pak
	set duration
	auto-save and power off
	snooze option?
add pak to install MiniUI boot logo?
add Version.pak?
	requires bin/show or bin/say
auto install updates?
	introduce in the last beta?

do another pass at defaults

make keymon write averaged/smoothed and scaled values to /tmp/adc or better yet msettings

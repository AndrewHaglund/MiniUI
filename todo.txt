-------------------------------

- fixed crash when opening empty sub-folders
- fixed vertical alignment of install/update message
- added extra sync before sleeping (in case SD is removed between sleep and power off)
- updated show binary to look in .system/res/ when using a relative path
- added confirm.png and okay.png to .system/res/

-------------------------------

- add actual version number to version message (or not?)
- press L on a save state to lock/unlock it?
- support two Emus folders, one at the root of the card
	so users don't have to root around in invisible folders
- add bin/needs-swap (see Trimui version)

	#!/bin/sh

	SD=/mnt/SDCARD
	SWAP=$SD/.userdata/swapfile
	if [ ! -f "$SWAP" ]; then
		say "Creating swap file"
		dd if=/dev/zero of=$SWAP bs=1M count=128
		chmod 600 $SWAP
		mkswap $SWAP
	fi
	swapon $SWAP

	touch /tmp/using-swap
	
then in MiniUI.pak/launch.sh after NEXT

	if [ -f /tmp/using-swap ]; then
		rm -f /tmp/using-swap
		swapoff -a
	fi
	

make keymon write averaged/smoothed and scaled values to /tmp/adc or better yet msettings
	check totofaki's battery curves (last I checked mine were the same as stock)

make sure Recently Played and libmmenu display the m3u file name instead of the content name
	libmmenu was easy
	Recently Played will be much more involved...
		because it is currently set to a specific disc
		which maybe isn't necessary since resume works from the m3u dir in the console folder? 
		but is that because open dir gets the specific disc?

create an Also Rans.zip of additional cores

add enable-simple-mode to readme

show, confirm, and say don't sleep (neither does Files.pak)
	thinking face

wrap all $(dirname "$0") in quotes to properly escape paths with spaces
	or store the result in a var then quote the var when using
change all logging from &> log to > log 2>&1

do another pass at defaults

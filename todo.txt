-------------------------------

- tweaked button label alignment
- added support for /.userdata/auto.sh for user additions

WARNING: errors in auto.sh may prevent MiniUI from launching which allows the stock system to modify your SD card, polluting the root of the card and your Roms folder with unnecessary subfolders, and removing the hook that allows MiniUI to boot. If this happens you will need to reinstall MiniUI. No userdata is lost when this happens, it's just annoying.

- can picoarch detect if a core supports save states?
	StupidHoroscope: From my messing around with it, there's a method in libretro cores called retro_serialize_size(), and if that returns zero, save-states aren't supported.
	https://docs.libretro.com/development/cores/developing-cores/#retro_serialize_size-retro_serialize-and-retro_unserialize 
	
- BUG: repo doesn't checkout correct branch for submodules when cloned...
- BUG: rumble not working in gambatte (does work on Onion)
	- gambatte detects rumble support, not sure what's happening...
- BUG: picoarch adds random prefix to rom names when zipped
	- which results in a new save file every launch (game not state)
	- only affects pokemini (and handy and ng pocket)
	neonloop: Some libretro cores ignore libretro save method and core saves itself, maybe this is difference?
- BUG: Sega CD might need a short delay to resume audio like pokemini
	https://github.com/shauninman/picoarch/blob/miniui-miyoomini/patches/pokemini/0001-fix-resume-audio.patch

- look into an audioserver-like approach to eliminating pop
	- I think picoarch already has a resampler...
	
- look into supafaust
	is it just the new hotness or an actual improvement over snes9x
	it might have MSU-1 support, which, eh, is fine for extras but not essential

- BUG: I think show et al need to make sure pan is set to 0,0?
	using after progressui sometimes results in the image not showing

- use smsplus-gx for SMS/GG?

- BUG: default st8 assumes first disc on multi-disc games
	- leaving for now

- scroll long names
	ugh, this will be harder than it needs to be because of the old Union cross-platform separation
- press L on a save state to lock/unlock it? to make it the default state to open instead of a cold launch?

picoarch should truncate the common parts of a group of options, not the (usually unique) ends

make keymon write averaged/smoothed and scaled values to /tmp/adc or better yet msettings
	check totofaki's battery curves (last I checked mine were the same as stock)

add enable-simple-mode to readme

show, confirm, and say don't sleep (neither does Files.pak)
	thinking face

wrap all $(dirname "$0") in quotes to properly escape paths with spaces
	or store the result in a var then quote the var when using

change all logging from &> log to > log 2>&1

do another pass at defaults?

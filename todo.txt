auto update next before anything else
	I keep adding an update then forgetting to run it :facepalm:

remove post-install.sh when updating

enable open/resuming from m3u hosted folder 
	but leave the disc listing logic in place in case I need to revert
	

add secret default state to libmmenu/picoarch

update.log is back
	
wrap all $(dirname "$0") in quotes to properly escape paths with spaces
	or store the result in a var then quote the var when using
change all logging from &> log to > log 2>&1

add Time Limit.pak
	set duration
	auto-save and power off
	snooze option?
add pak to install MiniUI boot logo?
add Version.pak?
	requires some sort of simple show or rather say command
auto install updates?
	introduce in the last beta?

do another pass at defaults

make keymon write averaged/smoothed and scaled values to /tmp/adc or better yet msettings
